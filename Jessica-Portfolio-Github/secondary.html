    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>My name is Jessica Luc, but I also go by Jessie. I am Chinese-Canadian, born and raised in Calgary, Canada, by a hardworking Chinese immigrant who has spent their life working to ensure that I have the opportunity for a better life than they did. I'm a first-year Interactive Design-Graphic Design student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. I excel in problem solving and enjoy coming across challenges as it gives me an opportunity to grow and improve on my skills. My love for art and design is what influenced me to pick graphic design as my degree as I love connecting with others through design and sharing unique ideas with others. I am excited to learn and grow in the program, connecting with other designers and expanding on my own skills.</p>
